<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am 22 years old and I live in Orlando, Florida. I moved to Orlando from Brooklyn, New York, when I was 15 years old. I attended high school at Lyman High in Longwood, Florida. After high school, I moved to Gainesville in 2020 and completed my associate's degree a few months later. Although I had never planned on attending the University of Florida, I decided to apply for fun and was accepted. I have been with the University of Florida for three years now, working towards my second degree. Moving frequently and embracing new opportunities has been a significant part of my journey, and I have enjoyed the experiences and growth that have come with attending UF.<p>
